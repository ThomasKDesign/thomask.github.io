I'm a beginner developer, and so I won't have some fancy site with all the cool animations and effects, yet!! I do however, have some projects below(not too fancy, but the work of a newbie) :) !!\r\n\r\n  - [DOM Manipulation](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-dom-manipulation/)\r\n  - [DOM Basics](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-dom-basics/)\r\n  - [Validating Form Data](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-validating-form-data/)\r\n  - [Imaginary Online Store-Html and CSS ](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1010-product-page/)\r\n  - [Static Website Deployment Using Apache Server ](http://2048.thomaskdesign.net/)\r\n   \r\n\r\nAnd so, stay tuned! It will go through changes from time to time!\r\n\r\nCome visit again in the not-so-distant future, and maybe I'll have something much better to showcase by then!!\r\n\r\n&copy;Thomas Kaiaua, 2016.
