I do however, have 4 below that I did as class projects(not too fancy, but the work of a newbie) :) !!\r\n\r\n1. [DOM Manipulation](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-dom-manipulation/)\r\n2. [DOM Basics](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-dom-basics/)\r\n3. [Validating Form Data](http://www.thomaskdesign.net/wats1020-validating-form-data/)\r\n4.
